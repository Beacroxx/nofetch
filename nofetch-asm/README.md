nofetch rewritten in assembly to be as small as possible. (319 bytes)
it runs in approximately 50Âµs on my machine.

to compile the assembly, run
```
nasm main.asm -o nofetch
chmod +x ./nofetch
```
## ! IMPORTANT !
this code will segfault if you do not have a /proc/version file where the opening bracket `(` is in the first 32 characters.
it will also print out garbage at the end if your kernel name is too short.
this can be fixed by adjusting the buffer length inside the file on line 74.
